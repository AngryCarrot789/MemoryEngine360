This is a remake of Cheat Engine, but for consoles (so far only Xbox 360). This project was inspired by https://github.com/XeClutch/Cheat-Engine-For-Xbox-360

# Download and build
- Clone repo: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/AngryCarrot789/MemEngine360`
- Open `MemEngine360.sln` and then run/debug.

If you wish to publish as a single .exe with a few (native) DLLs alongside, run `publish.bat` in the folder `MemEngine360.Avalonia`. This is how I create releases for this project
