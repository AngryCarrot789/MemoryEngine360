# ![](MemEngine360.Avalonia/icon-32.bmp) Memory Engine 360 v1.1.6
This is a remake of Cheat Engine, but for consoles (so far only Xbox 360). This project was inspired by https://github.com/XeClutch/Cheat-Engine-For-Xbox-360

### Additional Features (via Tools menu)
- Task Sequencer
- Debugger (WIP)
- Pointer Scanner

> Please take care when changing ('poking') values on your console. 
> You may break things, maybe even permanently if you change the wrong things.

# Download and build
- Clone repo: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/AngryCarrot789/MemEngine360`
- Open `MemEngine360.sln` and then run/debug.

If you wish to publish as a single .exe with a few (native) DLLs alongside, run `publish.bat` in the folder `MemEngine360.Avalonia`. This is how I create releases for this project
